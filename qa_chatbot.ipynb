When you get a loan with Kora, whether it’s KoraCash or KoraDrive, Kora will report your new account to the credit bureaus.  Throughout the life of the loan, Kora will report all payments, whether they are late or on-time.  Finally, once you payoff your loan, Kora will report if your loan was paid off successfully.  If, however, you fail to make payments, Kora will charge-off your account and report it as such to the bureaus.  A charge-off can have a devastating effect on your credit - it’s best to avoid a charge-off at all costs.\\n\\nTimelines\\n\\nNew accounts: Kora will report all new accounts within 2 weeks of an account opening\\nLate payments: Once an account is 30 days late, Kora will report the account as “derogatory” to the bureaus\\nSuccessful payoff: Kora will report all successfully paid off accounts as closed within 2 weeks of an account being paid off\\nCharge-off: Similar to payoffs, Kora reports all charge-off accounts within 2 weeks of the account being closed\\nNote: Charge-off accounts are still required to pay back the amount due\\nOnce Kora reports information to the credit bureaus, it can take anywhere from 30 to 45 days for your credit report to be updated.  This timeline is outside of Kora’s control and dependent on the credit bureaus.\\n\\nSee an issue on your credit report?\\n\\nMistakes may appear on your credit report from time to time.  If you notice something with your credit and it's outside of the timelines described above, you can dispute the issue.  Simply follow this link to complete the credit dispute form.

      "Q: Can international students use Kora? A: International students are welcome to use the Kora app and apply for both KoraCash and KoraDrive. At Kora, we believe all college students should have access to our financial products, with no exceptions. Kora provides loan services for qualified college and university students or recent graduates (graduated within a 3 year period).\n",
      "\n",
      "What if I don't have a credit score in the U.S.? If you're an international student looking to build credit in the U.S. you are eligible to apply for both KoraCash and KoraDrive without prior credit history. Making payments on both can help establish a positive credit history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you do not have a Social Security Number (“SSN”), major credit bureaus will hold onto your payment records reported by Kora. Once you get your SSN, the credit records you previously created (with your Kora loan for example) will be linked to your SSN. Note that you do need an SSN to apply for KoraCash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: App not working? Try closing it and downloading the most recent version. A: It's not a glitch in the Matrix—just an issue with updating. The Kora app updates live. That means within any given day, platform updates, bug fixes, new features and connections—they're all pushed out in real time. On the plus side: this makes Kora super-responsive to user issues. But one drawback is that previous versions of the app sometimes seize.\n",

      "\n",
      "If the app is behaving strangely, or you can't get something to load, go ahead and close out of the app. Then download the very latest version of Kora. Open, and see if this doesn't solve your problem.\n",

      "Q: How Do I Get in Touch with Kora? A: Kora uses a ticketing system to help manage the inquiries we receive on a daily basis. What is a \"ticketing system\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "By filling out a quick service request form, a service ticket is created and immediately submitted to our Customer Service Team for review. This is the fastest way to get in touch with us.\n",

      "1. Be sure you include your EDU email. We use this to locate your account.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Explain the issue in as much detail as possible for quicker support.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Avoid creating multiple tickets. Tickets are automatically assigned to the Customer Service Team, but multiple tickets can cause significant delays as multiple people work on the same issue.\n",

      "A: If you entered your address incorrectly or need to update it to a new address, we can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your Kora app, go to “Settings”, click on “Profile”, you should be able to change the address by tapping on “Edit”\n",
      "to answer in a helpful and precise manner to the question. \n",
      "At the beginning of the conversation, say hello to the customer.\n",
      "If you do not know the answer - say that you do not know and ask the customer to fill out the form at the https://share.hsforms.com/1rjnQzwR6SNyqRNcogAORSw3xrug?__hstc=226601154.3fb6da335f053b40ab025931f48d35a9.1708836206061.1708836206061.1708836206061.1&__hssc=226601154.18.1708836206061&__hsfp=752909049.\n",
